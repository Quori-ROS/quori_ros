The plane coefficients and real\nworld coordinates (x, y, and z) are related by the plane equation:\nAx + By + Cz + D = 0\nRemarks\nThe vector v = (A, B, C) represents the normal to the plane and D represents the\nsigned distance along the normal between the plane and the origin of the coordinate\nsystem. The the origin of the coordinate system is the camera's depth sensor"}
